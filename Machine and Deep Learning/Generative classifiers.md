classifiers that make predictions based on the distribution of the class. 

------

$\hat{p}(y \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{\hat{p}(\mathbf{x} \mid y) \, \hat{p}(y)}{\hat{p}(\mathbf{x})}$

+ We can find the full data distribution, and find  
outliers  
- If you have knowledge how data is generated,  
you can use it  
 - Often you have easy ways of estimating the  
parameters: maximum likelihood  

Cons:

- You need large training sets  
- The probabilistic model may be too simple
