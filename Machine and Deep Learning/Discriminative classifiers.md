--------

$\hat{p}(y \mid \mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w})$

- Can define very flexible models  
- May need less training data  

Cons
- Need to define the loss function  
- Finding optimal parameters is often very  
challenging  
- Outlier rejection not obvious  

Classifiers:

#### Naive bayes
#### Logistic classifier
$$
p(\omega_2 \mid \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \beta^T \mathbf{x})}
$$
The function looks like scalar: $f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x)$)
